"All cryptocurrencies and ICOs are scams" does intentionally sound too strong.
Especially in Spring of 2018 when blockchain buzz in the highest point.

Of course, not all cryptocurrencies and not completely will lead to loosing money.
It is that the voice of those promoting use of cryptocurrencies is so loud, that 
there should be place to reference all contra-arguments and words of caution.

## Coin minting

In an economy adding new money would be tax to all as more money for the same goods will give inflation.
Yet BitCoins and other have been on the rise.

## ICOs

ICO should be the clearest case of fraud, as new virtual currencies are not supported by current real value,
but prospects and promises.
And "tide rises all boats".
